## Career

### Authentic Vision

Authentic Vision is an industry leader in mobile authentication solutions, combating fraud and counterfeiting through their unique Holographic Fingerprint technology. This patented, tamper-evident hologram is incorporated into product packaging for verification using their CheckifReal app. The same technology is also implemented in banking cards, offering enhanced transaction security and robust fraud prevention. With real-time analytics and continuous product monitoring, Authentic Vision not only safeguards businesses' products but also provides valuable market insights.

#### Mobile App Development

* Redesigned and optimitzed the scan interface and app navigation, working closely with an external UX design agency to simplify the scanning process and enhance the user experience.
* Transformed the codebase using SwiftUI (iOS) and Jetpack Compose (Android), moved to Swift Package Manager for iOS Dependency Management, and simplified cross-platform translations, enabling quicker development cycles.
* Replaced Firebase notification services on iOS with a in-house solution, cutting down app size by approximately 30% and reducing maintenance effort significantly.
* Migrated the white-label application frontend from Obj-C to Swift on iOS and developed tailored versions for various customers on both platforms.
* Introduced various development features in the iOS app such as a recording service that interfaces with our internal S3, a new internal logging framework, and multiple in-app-debug functions, enhancing the development experience and improving the quality control of our products.

#### Backend Development

* Created a versatile in-house app distribution system that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline of the mobile apps, allowing for easy internal and external evaluation of different testing builds.
* Reengineered the delivery of In-App Notifications by splitting notification processing into a separate microservice and implementing APNS and FCM for push notifications, resulting in improved maintainability and scalability.
* Implemented a security feature in the core authentication service to restrict scanning operations to specific apps, thereby ensuring the maintenance of client data segregation.
* Established a Lua-based solution for dynamic feature management and A/B testing, which provides flexibility for feature rollouts and supports data-driven decision-making.
