## Employments

### Authentic Vision

#### Mobile App Development

* Redesigned and optimitzed the scan interface and app navigation, working closely with an external UX design agency to simplify the scanning process and enhance the user experience.
* Transformed the codebase using SwiftUI (iOS) and Jetpack Compose (Android), moved to Swift Package Manager for iOS Dependency Management, and simplified cross-platform translations, enabling quicker development cycles.
* Replaced Firebase notification services on iOS with a proprietary solution, cutting down app size by approximately 30% and reducing maintenance effort significantly.
* Migrated the white-label application from Obj-C to Swift on iOS and developed tailored versions for various customers on both platforms.
* Introduced various development features in the iOS app such as a recording service that interfaces with our internal S3, a new internal logging framework, and multiple in-app-debug functions, enhancing the development experience and promoting a clean, efficient workflow.

#### Backend Development

* Created a versatile in-house app distribution system that integrates with the CI/CD pipeline of the mobile apps, allowing for easy internal and external evaluation of different testing builds.
* Reengineered the delivery of In-App Notifications by splitting notification processing into a separate microservice and implementing APNS and FCM for push notifications, resulting in improved maintainability and scalability.
* Implemented a custom solution to restrict scanning operations to specific apps, thereby ensuring the maintenance of client data segregation.
* Established a Lua-based solution for dynamic feature management and A/B testing, which provides flexibility for feature rollouts and supports data-driven decision-making.
