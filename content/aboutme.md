Technology, in every way, shape and form, has always been my passion. Imagine me at seven years old, tinkering around with cables, batteries, light bulbs and speakers, building primitive "alarm systems" onto doors, triggering when somebody would open them.. well to the annoyance of my parents. :D

I soon moved into computers, realizing that this omnious thing called "Internet" could answer me everything that I wanted to know. Often I spent hours into the night (which back then meant nine o'clock of course) sitting in front of the screen, digging into everything that interested me.

When I received my first iPod at the age of twelve, I soon (well, besides listening to far to much music) jumped into taking apart mobile games, looking into how they store powerups, unlocks, high scores, etc. Luckily for me, most of the time it was just an unencrypted .plist or .txt file, making it very easy to tweak the numbers up a little. I mean, when Flappy Bird was a thing, it was pretty cool to show off my high score of 1000 or so. ;)

What actually got me into programming was once again a video game. On one of my late night internet session I stumbled across the Minecraft-Mod "ComputerCraft", that made it possible to program computers and turrets with Lua. By quite some trial and error and with the help of some YouTube-Tutorials (thank you so much ReduceTheBlock!) I teached myself the basics of programming, and well, I seemingly somehow stuck with it.

This was also the time when I had to decide which high school I would attend. I went with the HTL Salzburg, which was probably one of the best decisions of my life. Because, although it was a very challenging experience, I enjoyed every second of it: Being it the hard but sooo fascinating math, the (very long) days spent in nerdy laboratories, and all the amazing people I had the honour to meet there, students and teachers alike - many of them I am still friends with to this day.

During my high school years, I also found an amazing part-time gig at my family's Discotheque, where I worked as a "Light Jockey." This unique experience taught me a lot about visual effects and coordination, while also humbling me as I realized the importance of teamwork and the equality of every person involved in creating a mesmerizing experience for our guests.

As I continued to explore, I found my way back to modding Minecraft. This time, I dived deeper into creating PvP hacks like tracers and ESP, battling with OpenGL and wishing I had more knowledge in Linear Algebra back then. ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯  I shared these mods with my friends, and together we enjoyed pushing the limits of the game.

After graduating from HTL, I spent a year (July 2019 to June 2020) completing my civil service, which was extended to 12 months due to the corona pandemic. To be honest, I didn't enjoy that time, as it made me feel like my skills were pretty underutilized and my contributions undervalued.

In autumn 2020, I got the chance to work at Raiffeisenbank in their Raiffeisen Technik Zentrum. While I appreciated the opportunity, the bureaucratic environment and practices weren't quite my cup of tea. I was grateful for the experience, but I knew I wanted something that aligned more with my interests and goals.

Fortunately, I landed a job at Authentic Vision in January 2021, and it's been a fantastic experience ever since. The tech stack is a pleasure to work with, and the company culture emphasizes excellence and innovation. My colleagues are not only highly intelligent, but they also have a great sense of humor. It's just a fantastic atmosphere, and we're building something seriously cool together.

In autumn 2021, when all the corona-dust somewhat started to settle down, I decided to hit the books again and started studying while cutting my weekly hours at Authentic Vision to 22. Mixing theory and practice has been incredibly rewarding, and I'm surrounded by a community of brilliant, motivated people. They keep me inspired and make this new chapter in my life a whole lot of fun.

When I'm not busy with work or studying, I love to let loose and have some fun. Hitting the nightlife and grooving to techno music is always a blast, and I'm a big fan of inviting a bunch of friends over for gaming nights – whether it's board games or video games, it's all about the good times. I also really enjoy nature, taking a walk in the neighbouring woods to unwind. Food-wise, I love exploring new (vegetarian) dishes at restaurants and sharing my finds with family and friends. Speaking of family, I cherish the time spent with them, especially when it comes to enjoying my dad's mouthwatering main courses and my mum's heavenly desserts.

My passion for technology is always with me. I've dived into loads of hardware and software projects, turning every corner of my apartment into a smart space. One of my proudest (and, okay, maybe a bit silly) achievements is my electrically extendable sofa that I can control with my phone. These personal projects are a blast and super educational, helping me learn new skills and broaden my knowledge.

As I continue to pursue my passion for technology in both my personal and professional life, I'm always on the lookout for new challenges. Eager to learn, grow, and share my experiences with others, my journey has been filled with ups and downs, but I wouldn't trade it for anything. I'm excited to see what the future holds and how technology will continue to shape our world.
