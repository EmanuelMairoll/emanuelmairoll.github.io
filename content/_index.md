Hello there! My name is Emanuel and I'm developer based in Salzburg, Austria.

I've been writing code for more than a decade, working for a few years as a Mobile App Developer, but also on the backend, data pipelines, DevOps and Infrastructure, always loving what I do.

I am into CyberSec, IoT, Electronics and all other related black magic. Here you can find all about me, and read about stuff I find worth sharing. 

Feel free to take a look around!
