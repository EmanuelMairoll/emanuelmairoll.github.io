Hello there! My name is Emanuel and I'm based in Zürich, Switzerland.

Currently I'm doing my MSc in Cyber Security at ETH Zürich, while working part-time as a research assistant at the ETH Network Security Group.

I've been writing code and hacking stuff for more than a decade. I am into CyberSec, Mobile Development, IoT, Electronics and all other related black magic. Here you can find all about me, and read about stuff I find worth sharing. 

Feel free to take a look around!
