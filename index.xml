Imagine me at seven years old, tinkering around with cables, batteries, light bulbs and speakers, building primitive &amp;ldquo;alarm systems&amp;rdquo; onto doors, triggering when somebody would open them.. well to the annoyance of my parents. :D
I soon moved into computers, realizing that this omnious thing called &amp;ldquo;Internet&amp;rdquo; could answer me everything that I wanted to know. Often I spent hours into the night (which back then meant nine o&amp;rsquo;clock of course) sitting in front of the screen, digging into everything that interested me.</description></item></channel></rss>
